# Laravel Travel Tracking API & Admin Panel

This project was developed using **Laravel** and consists of two main components:
1. An **API** to support the mobile app.
2. An **Admin Panel** to view metrics and data collected, which is protected and accessible only to admin users.

### API Features
The API provides the following functionality:
- **Authentication**: User login and registration.
- **User Information**: Retrieve user details.
- **Trips**: Fetch the user's trips, active trip, and start/end trips.
- **Location Tracking**: Record the user's location during trips.

### Admin Panel Features
The Admin Panel is built with Laravel and includes features related to:
- **Authentication**: Admin user login, password recovery, and updates powered by Laravel.
- **Trip and Location Data**: Admins can view all trip and location data collected for each user.
- **Distance Calculation**: The ability to calculate distances between users at each minute during their trips, based on the collected location data.

### Project Status
This project is functional but is still in the early stages. The API and Admin Panel serve as a proof of concept and are being developed further.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
